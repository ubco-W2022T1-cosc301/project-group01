## Describe your topic/interest in about 150-200 words

The topics we are interested in looking at are what social factors impact student performance. Social aspects like parental educational backgrounds, how wealthy a student is, or their gender can easily influence the way students learn and apply their knowledge. Therefore, through this project we hope to illuminate the correlations between specific social aspects such as financial support and gender and how well students do on exams. Additionally, knowing that UBCO has all types of students from all over the world, we want to try to understand why students do better in school than others. A question we specifically want to explore is, "Do females often do better on standarized tests in comparison to men?" Our findings in this project can not only help us understand students but it can also help professors understand and sympathize with students  to create a better learning environment. Overall, as university students, we think this is an important topic that should be focused on because it allows students to understand each other more, and we can make UBCO a better place. 
## Describe your dataset in about 150-200 words

**Please remember to update this section**

Our dataset focuses on standardized testing outcomes in three different categories being math, reading, and writing and also looks at other life factors that could have impacts on these scores and may reveal a relationship that exists between testing and circumstances outside of school. Some of the other factors include gender, race/ethnicy, parental level of education, if they eat lunch and if they took a test preparation course. Since our dataset has a variety of variables and lots of data to supplement it, there are many possible outcomes that we can derive from this dataset, and make inferences based on the relationships that exist in this data. In all I hope that through looking at this dataset, we can discover an objective connection that shows that standardized testing might not be the most effective way of proving intellect, especially when many facotrs outside of school can effect how children perform on them.
