# The Socioeconomic Bias of Not-So-Standarized Testing 
In this project, Noah, Peter, and Tina explored a data set called "Student Performance in Exams". Within this project, we each explored different socioeconomic factors that impact student performance on Standarized Tests. As university students from different backgrounds, we were interested to explore how these socioeconomic factors may affect student performance because we are university students studying at UBC, a university with many international students. Through our analysis, we hope to emphasize and acknowledge how social and financial class, gender, and race are important elements to consider when it comes to student performance. Ultimately, our findings will highlight 
## EDA Highlights for Analysis 3
For my analysis I wanted to see the correlation between overall score, race/ethnicity, and test preparation course completion. To collect the data for my analysis, I made a variable called 'total score' that summed the values of students' reading, writing, and math scores into one variable. Additionally, I dropped the columns/variables that were not pertaining to my research such as gender, parental level of eduction, and lunch. I then went on to create, a pairplot(Fig.1), barplot(Fig.2), and a displot(Fig.3) to help visualize the dataset and reinforce my research question.
