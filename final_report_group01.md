In this project, Noah, Peter, and Tina explored a data set called "Student Performance in Exams". Within this project, we each explored different socioeconomic factors that impact student performance on Standarized Tests. As university students from different backgrounds, we were interested to explore how these socioeconomic factors may affect student performance because we are university students studying at UBC, a university with many international students. Through our analysis, we hope to emphasize and acknowledge how social and financial class, gender, and race are important elements to consider when it comes to student performance. Ultimately, our findings will highlight 

## Exploratory Data Analysis Highlights for Analysis 2: 
- Analysis 2: In my analysis, I investigated whether or not one sex perform beter on standarized exams than the other. After utlizing the "gender", "writing scores","reading scores", and "math scores" columns, I found the averagesd of each test score to ultimately conclude that females perform better on standarized exams than males. 
## EDA Highlights for Analysis 3
For my analysis I wanted to see the correlation between overall score, race/ethnicity, and test preparation course completion. To collect the data for my analysis, I made a variable called 'total score' that summed the values of students' reading, writing, and math scores into one variable. Additionally, I dropped the columns/variables that were not pertaining to my research such as gender, parental level of eduction, and lunch. I then went on to create, a pairplot(Fig.1), barplot(Fig.2), and a displot(Fig.3) to help visualize the dataset and reinforce my research question.

## Question 1 + results
For my question I decided to explore how a parent's education level affects their child's results on standardized exams. I felt that this question was an important one to look into because, it could prove if a student's parents having a formal education gives an unfair advantage. This is crucial since many schools across the world rely on testing, which we have proven to be bias towards students of different socioeconomic statuses.

To begin my analysis I first decided to look into whether there existed a correlation between students grades and thier parents education level.

*The heatmap shows that there exists a strong correlation between the math, reading and writing scores, making it a viable option to use an average score in my analysis.*
